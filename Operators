-- Arithmetic Operators
+   --> Addition
-   --> Subtraction
*   --> Multiplication
/   --> Division
MOD(x, y) --> Returns remainder of x divided by y
 
-- Comparison Operators
=   --> Equal to
!=  --> Not equal to
<>  --> Not equal to (alternate syntax)
>   --> Greater than
<   --> Less than
>=  --> Greater than or equal to
<=  --> Less than or equal to
 
-- Logical Operators
BETWEEN --> Between two values (inclusive)
IN  --> Matches any value in a list
LIKE --> Pattern matching (e.g., LIKE 'A%') (Wildcards -> %, _)
IS NULL --> Checks if value is NULL
IS NOT NULL --> Checks if value is NOT NULL
AND --> True if both conditions are true
OR  --> True if any one condition is true
NOT --> Reverses the condition
 
-- Set Operators
UNION      --> Combines results, removes duplicates
UNION ALL  --> Combines all results including duplicates
INTERSECT  --> Returns only matching rows from both queries
MINUS      --> Returns rows from first query not in second
 
-- String Operator
||  --> Concatenates two strings

-- Subquery/Membership Operators
EXISTS --> Returns true if subquery returns rows
ANY    --> Compares with any value from subquery
ALL    --> Compares with all values from subquery
 
-- Hierarchical Query Operators
CONNECT BY --> Defines parent-child relationship
START WITH --> Specifies root row for hierarchy
LEVEL       --> Shows depth level in hierarchy
SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH --> Returns path from root to node
 
-- Miscellaneous Operators/Functions
IS [NOT] NULL --> Check for (non) null
CAST(expr AS type) --> Convert data type
COALESCE(a, b, c, ...) --> First non-null value
NVL(expr1, expr2) --> Replace NULL with another value
DECODE(expr, val1, res1, val2, res2, ...) --> IF-THEN-ELSE logic
CASE WHEN cond THEN result [...] ELSE default END --> Conditional logic
 
-- Bitwise (PL/SQL)
BITAND(x, y) --> Bitwise AND
