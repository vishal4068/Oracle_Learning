#CASE Statement
-- Write multiple condition in single SELECT statement and return single value based on condition.
-- Help us to write multiple nestead conditions
-- We can use with SELECT and UPDATE only
-- When using UPDATE make sure to use ELSE part because if you don't mension ELSE part it will assign NULL value to all field if any condition is not satisfy.

Syntax:
      CASE
            WHEN condition1 THEN result1
            WHEN condition2 THEN result2
            ...
            ELSE default_result
      END;

Example:
1)
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary,
      CASE
        WHEN salary >= 100000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
      END AS salary_grade
FROM employees;
 
2) 
UPDATE employees
SET bonus =
  CASE
    WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 5000
    WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 3000
    -- No ELSE given
  END;

--Employees with salary > 100000 get bonus 5000.
Employees with salary > 50000 get bonus 3000.
Others will get bonus set to NULL because there's no ELSE

3) If we want to keep existing values for others use ELSE
UPDATE employees
SET bonus =
  CASE
    WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 5000
    WHEN salary > 50000 THEN 3000
    ELSE bonus  -- keep current value
  END;
