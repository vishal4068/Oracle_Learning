#SELECT 
SELECT * FROM table_name;

#Limiting Rows
1) FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY (Oracle 12c and above)

SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
 
Use case: Get top 5 highest paid employees.

2) OFFSET ... FETCH
 
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id
OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
 
Use case: Skip first 10 rows, then fetch next 5 (pagination: page 3 with 5 rows per page).

3) ROWNUM (Old school)
 
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
 
Limitation: ROWNUM is assigned before ORDER BY, so it might not return top rows unless you wrap it.

4) ROWNUM with subquery + ORDER BY
 
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
 
Use case: Correct way to use ROWNUM after ordering.

5) ROWNUM with pagination (older Oracle versions)
 
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT e.*, ROWNUM rn FROM (
    SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY employee_id
  ) e
  WHERE ROWNUM <= 20
)
WHERE rn > 10;
 
Use case: Emulates pagination (rows 11 to 20).
